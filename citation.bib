 abstract = {Although attempts to introduce international regulation as a device to benefit cocoa producing countries have failed in the past five years, considerable pressure remains to try again. In this study, estimates are formed of the probable changes in some of the relevant variables if an international monopolistic cocoa pricing agreement were implemented. On the basis of new estimates of cocoa supply and demand relations, effects of the hypothetical institution of discriminatory monopolistic pricing in 1964 are examined. Such an agreement would have resulted in marginal, although possibly important, additions to the leading cocoa producing countries' command over external resources; but stock accumulation or surplus disposal problems might have been troublesome, and long-run supplies would have increased substantially unless producers were effectively isolated from the world market.},

abstract = {This work introduces a methodology to estimate coffee prices based on the use of Extreme Learning Machines. The process is initiated by identifying the presence of nonstationary components, like seasonality and trend. These components are withdrawn if they are found. Next, the temporal lags are selected based on the response of the Partial Autocorrelation Function filter. As predictors, we address the following models: Exponential Smoothing (ES), Autoregressive (AR) and Autoregressive Integrated and Moving Average (ARIMA) models, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) neural networks. The computational results based on three error metrics and two coffee types (Arabica and Robusta) showed that the neural networks, especially the ELM, can reach higher performance levels than the other models. The methodology, which presents preprocessing stages, lag selection, and use of ELM, is a novelty that contributes to the coffee prices forecasting field.}

This study uses secondary data at two diffferent markets, world and domestic markets. Three forecating techniques apply in this research, namely, MA, ARIMA and Decomposition The most appropriate model to forecast world and domestic coffee prices are the ARIMA model. This conclusion is based on the lowest MAPE, MAD and MSD values.}

abstract = {India is the land of spices and is the largest producer, consumer and the exporter of spices in the world. Spices are an important component of Indian Agricultural Exports earning valuable foreign exchange and are the source of livelihood for millions of small and marginal farmers across different states of the country. Modeling of agricultural exports in general and spices exports in particular is important in the contest of spices exports being a priority area for Indian policy makers. Time series modeling of agricultural commodity exports is an active area of research in recent times. Generally Box Jenkins approach (ARIMA) is the referred technique for this purpose. When data exhibits volatility clustering, ARCH/GARCH models are used .When the data does not support linearity assumptions neutral network models are used. However, real world time series data is believed to be a combination of linear and non-linear patterns. In this context, Hybrid models which are a combination of AR models and Artificial Neural Networks are providing more accurate forecasts. The present study, using secondary data for the period from 1960-61 to 2017-18 applies three hybrid models for forecasting Indian spices exports both in terms of volume and prices. Based on the RMSE each model is evaluated and finally model with least RMSE was selected for forecasting both volume and unit prices of total spices export for the coming 10 years (2018-19 to 2027-28). Analysis of data was done with the help of open source software R. Results from the study show that, Hybrid model consisting of ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing and Tbats Model with unequal weights was found to be the best model on the basis of RMSE for forecasting Indian spices exports. Thus, for both forecasting and policy formulation the hybrid model is recommended.},

journal = {Universal Journal of Agricultural Research},
abstract = {In this paper, models are developed to explain and forecast the effect of world cocoa price on production of cocoa in Ghana by using regression model with time series errors. The focus of the investigation was to find out whether the world cocoa price can assist in forecasting the future behavior of the cocoa production in Ghana. Annual data from 1961 to 2010 were used in fitting the model while 2011 and 2012 were used as out-of-sample data. Based on the behavior of several model adequacy techniques, the regression model with ARIMA(2,2,0) errors was considered as the ‘best' model for the production variable. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), as a forecast accuracy measure, was used to validate the model. Thus, the MAPE of the regression model with ARIMA (2,2,0) errors was 7.97%. However, the conventional ‘best' ARIMA model fitted to the production variable indicated an MAPE of 16%. This shows that, the production variable has smaller MAPE, when it was modeled together with world price using regression with ARIMA errors. Hence, regression model with ARIMA (2,2,0) errors is a better statistical technique in forecasting production of cocoa in Ghana than the conventional ARIMA method.}
